# Arduino-Elevator-System


## Project Description:
This project is an elevator system using an Arduino board. It allows users to select the desired floor and display it on a 7-Segment screen. The project also includes measuring the weight in the elevator and displaying the remaining weight allowed on the screen. The project includes the following parts and elements:

## Parts and Elements:

- Arduino Board.
- Force Sensor for weight measurement.
- 7-Segment Display for showing floor numbers.
- Control buttons for selecting floors and allowed weight.
- An elevator weight scale.
- Wiring connections and other electronic components.
## Project Features:

- Selection of the desired floor for the elevator.
- Displaying the floor number on the 7-Segment screen.
- Measuring the weight in the elevator and displaying the remaining allowed weight on the screen.
- Providing control buttons for adjusting and selecting floors and allowed weight.
## Instructions for Use:

1. Connect the force sensor to the analog input port (A0) on the Arduino board.
2. Connect the 7-Segment display, buttons, weight sensor, and other elements according to the project's electrical diagram.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE development environment.
4. Run the project and use the buttons to select the floor while monitoring the displayed floor number and measuring the allowed weight.
